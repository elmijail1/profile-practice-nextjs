# Profile Practice

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description
This is a fullstack web app that lets users sign up, manage their profile, add friends, and view other users.

Please note that it's a learning-focused project ‚Äì hence, in its current form it's not a standalone commercial app. Yet though it's built for practice, it features real-world functionality ‚Äì and shows what solutions I've come up with during development.

## ü§î Why did I make this app?
After finishing my first app ([Georgian Transilterator](https://github.com/elmijail1/georgian-transliterator)), I wanted to explore user authentication ‚Äì a powerful and widespread feature I barely knew how to implement. To be honest, at first I didn't even realize that it required a backend ‚Äì you live and learn ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And this app became a playground for several essential web development concepts, like authentication, session expiration, database callbacks, etc. I believe that it's safe to say that it helped me transition from a frontend-only mindset to actually building a fullstack app. The learning curve was steep and at times it wasn't easy to carry on, but the result was well worth it.

## üõ† Tech stack
1. Next.js
2. TypeScript
3. PostgresQL
4. Prisma
5. NextAuth

### Development notes
#### 1. Next.js
At first, I planned to use React and Firebase. I switched to Next.js after deciding to have more control over my backend. With time I've come to appreciate how beginner-friendly and powerful Next is. The only notable issue with it was debugging session expiration behavior on the client ‚Äì its aggessive cache prevented my solution from working properly. Figuring out what the problem was and how to fix it was truly a learning opportunity in disguise!

#### 2. TypeScript
I started in plain JS, but decided to adopt TypeScript after seeing it in a Next tutorial. It slowed me down at some moments (all those linting errors...) but in the long run it definitely improved my code's precision.

#### 3. PostgresQL
My first time using a relational database in an app. Smooth experience overall, so far haven't had any notable issues with it. And speaking of issues...

#### 4. Prisma
Prisma gave me headache a couple of times. Its setup wasn't smooth sailing, as I was "lucky" to start using Prisma after it got a major update ‚Äì the docs had conflicting information probably because of that. Another issue was with deployment on Vercel ‚Äì seems to be a compatibility issue. Popular solutions didn't work for me, so I just moved to Railway which worked fine. Overall, Prisma does its job well, but the guidelines could be clearer. However, it's also worth noting that its developers added a chatbot on their website ‚Äì props to them for that!

#### 5. NextAuth
Authentication was the most challenging part. NextAuth seems to be pretty poewrful, but also has a steep learning curve. I'm definitely planning to revisit in future projects to get a better command of it.

This app isn't perfect ‚Äì and that's okay. I built it to learn.
Still, there's room for improvement (performance, UX, design), and I'm always open to feedback. Feel ree to fork, play around, or suggest changes ‚Äì I'll be happy to revisit it!
